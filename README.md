This tool helps you quickly scaffold new projects with essential utilities and optional libraries, making fullstack development easier and more efficient.

## Features

- **Quick Scaffolding**: Create new projects in seconds.
- **Vite**: Fast build times and hot module replacement.

## Getting Started

To get started with Dev Tools Hub, you need to download the latest release. You can find it [here](https://github.com/DreamlandSR/dev_tools_hub/releases). Download the file and execute it to begin.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 12 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- A terminal or command prompt

## Usage

After installation, you can create a new project by running:

```bash
dev-tools create my-project
```

Replace `my-project` with your desired project name. The CLI will prompt you to choose from various options, including the choice of libraries and features.

### Example Commands

1. **Create a basic project**:

   ```bash
   dev-tools create my-basic-project
   ```

2. **Create a project with Axios**:

   ```bash
   dev-tools create my-axios-project --axios
   ```

3. **Create a project with Zustand**:

   ```bash
   dev-tools create my-zustand-project --zustand
   ```

## Included Libraries

Dev Tools Hub allows you to include several optional libraries during project creation:

- **Axios**: Promise-based HTTP client for the browser and Node.js.
- **Zustand**: A small, fast, and scalable state-management solution.

You can choose these libraries during the scaffolding process, making it easy to set up your development environment according to your needs.
